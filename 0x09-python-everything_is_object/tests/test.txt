magic_string = __import__('100-magic_string').magic_string

for i in range(10):
    print(magic_string())

30. Low memory cost
#advanced



Write a class LockedClass with no class or object attribute, 
that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, 
except if the new instance attribute is called first_name.

You are not allowed to import any module
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x09$ cat 101-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
LockedClass = __import__('101-locked_class').LockedClass

lc = LockedClass()
lc.first_name = "John"
try:
    lc.last_name = "Snow"
except Exception as e:
    print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x09$ ./101-main.py
