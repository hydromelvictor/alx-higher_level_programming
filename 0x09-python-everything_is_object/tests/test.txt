Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with 
default options/configuration:

How many int objects are created by the execution of 
the first line of the script? (103-line1.txt)
How many int objects are created by the execution of 
the second line of the script (103-line2.txt)

Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 
with default options/configuration:

Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), 
how many int objects have been created and are still in memory? (105-line1.txt)
Why? (optional blog post :))
